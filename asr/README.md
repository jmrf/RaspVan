# ASR (aka Automatic Speech Recognition)

The ASR component is based on [vosk-api](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).

This component is just a client capturing audio frames from a microphone and
requesting the STT conversion to a RaspberryPi adapted dockerized
[vosk-server](https://github.com/jmrf/pyvosk-rpi)
